## Elitcat Protocol Overview
### About Elitcat-ID
#### Personal identification in the virtual world
Elitcat Protocol proposes a cutting-edge system that gives our community complete control over their private data and identity, redefining the way credentials are issued and verified in the virtual world.

Elitcat Protocol is a permissionless self-sovereign identity infrastructure. Powered by Zero-Knowledge Proof, you’ll be able to own, manage, and share verifiable credentials securely and privately. Elitcat Protocol also presents a diverse range of opportunities for builders to build Sybil prevention algorithms, reputation systems, credit systems, personal data markets, decentralized review systems, and beyond.

Why does this matter to you? First of all, your identity and private data become your assets, including your followers on social media, your avatars, your achievements in games, and more. You get to decide the when, what, and how for your data — because you truly OWN them. You won’t need a notary to prove your house belongs to you. You won’t need to send your whole bank statement to prove you have a certain amount of money. This might seem a little farfetched, but in a world where AIs are writing your emails and cars are driving you to places, this is the future, and it’s near.
